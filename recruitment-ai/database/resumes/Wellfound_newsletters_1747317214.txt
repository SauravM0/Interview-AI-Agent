Company Spotlight: SafetyWing




In this week's 'Why Work Here' series, we chat with Sondre Rasch 
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/srasch/>, CEO and Co-Founder, to discover what 
makes SafetyWing <https://safetywing.com/> a great place to work.

Key Insights:



For job seekers - Find companies where authenticity and joy are valued 
alongside productivity, creating environments where you can bring your real 
self while still achieving exceptional results.



For recruiters - "Pick the weeds in your culture garden" 
relentlessly—maintaining strong values requires consistent reinforcement and 
addressing misalignments early before they undermine what makes your company 
special.



For founders - Build through concentrated "Build Weeks" where cross-functional 
teams focus intensely on specific outcomes, accomplishing in one week what 
might otherwise take months through focused sprints.

Job Search Tip: Beat the ATS by speaking its language 



Bryan Williams <https://www.linkedin.com/in/bwilliams05>, Senior Technical 
Recruiter atApptronik <https://apptronik.com/>, reveals in a rare moment of 
transparency: "For roles with 500 applicants, you'd be shocked at how many 
don't even make it past the first filter. It's not feasible for me to manually 
review each one." 



While this reality might be frustrating, knowing how the ATS system works 
gives you the power to beat it.



✅ Mirror exact keywords from job descriptions
✅ Modify job titles to match what employers are searching for
✅ Place relevant skills prominently where ATS scans first
❌ Don't use jargon that might not match company terminology
❌ Don't submit identical applications for different positions
